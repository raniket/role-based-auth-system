## Some details about this project.
* This project contains both the front-end and back-end code.
* The back-end code resies in api directory, which is implemented using Express.js
* The front-end code is in root direcotory of this project, which is implemented using React.js

## To run this project, you will need to do two things:
1. Run the server.
2. Run the client.

### But first thing first, you should clone this repo in you local machine!!!

## 1. Run the server
To run the server you need to do the following steps:
1. Go to the root directory of the project.
2. Run the command `cd api` to go into the server root dir.
3. Run the command `npm install or yarn` to install all the dependency needed by the server.
4. Run the command `nodemon index.js` to start the server. (now the server is up and running).
5. Run the command `cd ..` to go back to projects root directory.

## 2. Run the client
To run the client you need to do the following steps:
1. Run the command `npm install or yarn` to install all the dependency needed by the client.
2. Run the command `yarn start` to start the client application.
3. You will be notifed on your terminal on which port the client app can be accessed.
4. Copy the url from the terminal and past it in you browser search box.

### Tada the project is now up and running

## YOU CAN IGNORE THE FOLLOWING DETAILS BELOW.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
